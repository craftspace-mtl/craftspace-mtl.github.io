			<h1>These Are The 2022 Decor Trends Designers Are Most Excited About</h1>
			<p>Home decor trends are always changing, but when it comes to 2022—a new year on the tails of some pretty challenging times—one phrase rings true for everything from home design to our daily lives: according to Designer & Manager of Production Design at Living Spaces, Jessica Harris, things will be perfectly imperfect. </p>
			<h1>Neutral & Natural Shades</h1>
			<p>Here’s the thing, neutral and natural colors never go out of style. But we’re expecting to see even more of these shades in the new year.</p>
			<p>After a year (and more) of living and working at home, we’re more inclined to create a peaceful environment. This naturally lends itself to neutral tones.</p>
			<h1>Green & Pink Accents</h1>
			<p>On the other hand, there's still room for color. 2022 is all about greens and pinks—in a way you’ve never seen them before. Think deeper, jewel-toned greens and rooted, terracotta pinks,” says M+A Architects Interior Designer Abbey Hunter. “Considering color psychology and human behavioral needs as we shift to endemic living, it all makes sense—these hues of green are soothing and signal safety to the brain, while the deep pinks in muted palettes radiates warmth and comfort—all meeting the basic needs we are starving for post-pandemic.”</p>
			<h1>Biophilic Design</h1>
			<p>The focus on green hues in 2022 home décor trends can also be attributed to the increase in nature-based or biophilic designs (and our growing love for plants, of course!). Whether the goal is to bring nature inside or to simply freshen the home with natural hues, live plants are becoming even more popular as we head into 2022. </p>
			<h1>Curved Furniture</h1>
			<p>“The curved furniture trend took off this past year, reviving a timeless mid-century trend that dates back to the '60s and '70s,” shares Franklin. “We don’t see it going away anytime soon, and in fact, we think more people will begin leaning into the idea of curvy pieces—whether it be with mirrors, kitchen islands or statement furniture such as barrel back chairs.”</p>
			<h1>Sustainable Materials</h1>
			<p>“Eco-friendly materials will be more popular than ever before,” shares Yoselin Castro, Senior Interior Designer at Mackenzie Collier Interiors. “People are seeing the advantages of integrating energy-efficient products in their spaces as a way to reduce heating and lighting needs.”</p>
			<p>As we head into 2022, we’ve forgone polished for functional, defined for entangled, and homemade for store-bought. The message? Homes that are real rather than resembling an untouched magazine.</p>
